\section{Mixture Models}
\subsection{Soft Clustering}
The term Soft clustering is ambiguous since it can refer to the algorithm or to the model:
\begin{description}
\item[Algorithmic] Soft $K$-Means: Instead of assigning a point to exactly one cluster. Consider assigning a probability that a data point belongs to a certain cluster. 
\item[Model relaxation]
\end{description}
